The system might not be reflecting the correct holdings or might be experiencing an internal error.\n\nGiven this situation, it’s prudent to wait and check the technical state of the portfolio and resolve any inconsistencies. Meanwhile, the current plan is to hold on to the positions given the cash reserve and verify sales capabilities again later.\n\n### Final Notes\n- The portfolio is currently balanced except for BTC, which has a slightly oversized allocation.\n- Keep the cash reserve steady for potential future rebalancing once the system allows trades.\n- Follow up on the technical issue preventing the ability to sell positions.\n\nThe evaluation is complete for now. If the erroneous issues resolve, conduct the recommended sell trades to maintain portfolio objectives.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
