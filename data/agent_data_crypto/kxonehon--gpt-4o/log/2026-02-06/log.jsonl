{"signature": "kxonehon--gpt-4o", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "The calculated total value of the holdings, including cash, is approximately **$37,721.38**. The cash position alone is about **$983.04**. Given the constraints and the apparent issues with selling during this session, no immediate rebalance actions can be conducted directly. \n\n**Key takeaways:**\n- The total portfolio value is predominantly held in crypto, with a very low cash position relative to the entire portfolio’s value.\n- Future actions should focus on addressing these operational issues regarding sales to better manage risk and position sizing directly.\n\nAt this point, no further operations concerning portfolio rebalancing or sales can be executed until the apparent transactional bottleneck is resolved. I will maintain the current positions as they are for now.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
