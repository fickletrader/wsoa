Despite showing 50,000 USDT in cash, the system is reporting insufficient funds for executing trades. This could be due to:\n\n1. A potential system synchronization issue\n2. A temporary trading restriction\n3. A potential settlement period requirement\n\nRecommendation:\n1. We should verify the actual cash balance and trading permissions\n2. Once confirmed, we can proceed with the planned allocation strategy\n3. The strategic allocation plan is ready to be implemented when the technical issues are resolved\n\nFor now, our portfolio remains:\n- Cash: 50,000 USDT (100%)\n- Crypto: 0 (0%)\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to try executing the trades again or if we should investigate the trading system status first.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
