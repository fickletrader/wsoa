{"signature": "jpowell--claude-3.5-sonnet", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "I apologize for the technical difficulties in executing trades. It seems there might be an issue with the trading system or cash calculation. Let me document what we intended to do and recommend for follow-up:\n\nIntended Portfolio Allocation:\n1. Cash Buffer: 12,500 USDT (25%)\n2. Planned Positions (6,250 USDT each):\n   - BTC: ~0.07 BTC\n   - ETH: ~2.08 ETH\n   - SOL: ~50 SOL\n   - LINK: ~528 LINK\n   - AVAX: ~518 AVAX\n   - XRP: ~3,275 XRP\n\nUnfortunately, I'm encountering technical issues with trade execution. This could be due to:\n1. System latency or timing issues\n2. Potential discrepancy in cash balance calculations\n3. Possible trading restrictions or limits\n\nRecommendation:\n1. Verify the system's trading capabilities and cash balance\n2. Consider executing trades individually with smaller sizes\n3. Monitor system status and retry when conditions normalize\n\nFor now, we remain in cash position (50,000 USDT) until we can successfully execute trades. We should attempt to implement this allocation strategy once the technical issues are resolved.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
