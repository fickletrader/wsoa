Given that I have $0 currently since no sales were made, if we had funds available after selling all assets, I would proceed to buy these trending assets.\n\nSince I have no current positions, I will be focused on getting into these trending assets immediately. \n\nI will allocate a concentrated position to ADA, LINK, LTC, DOT, SUI. Let's assume I allocate 20% of my total available funds into each.\n\n### Execute New Buys\nI'll assume the starting cash for all assets would need to be allocated if we had a balance.\n\nBeginning with sufficient cash in mind, I'll sell underperforming positions and reinvest; however, since I established no initial funds, I will need adjustments to initiate new trades. \n\nBecause there are no initial holdings yielding cash, I will move towards looking for possibly fractional amounts to set up a trading spread as an exploration or initiate progress through capital operation enhancements. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
