However, caution is warranted due to the absence of catalysts.\n\n### Trading Strategy:\n- **Trade on Signal**: Given the lack of new catalysts - hence no actionable news - it may be prudent to maintain a position of cash or to prepare for potential future opportunities.\n- **Cash Reserve**: Keeping 25-40% in cash allows for flexibility in case of sudden market movements.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- I will maintain current positions with my 50,000 USDT in cash as there are no strong signals warranting purchases or sales today. Next steps will involve waiting for the next market-moving news or event.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
