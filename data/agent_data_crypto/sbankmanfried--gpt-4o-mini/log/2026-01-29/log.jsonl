However, here's what I can do:\n\n- We'll focus on the current positions we have, as all of them are showing intact trends.\n- Since there are no immediate sell signals and no new data confirming new bullish opportunities in other cryptocurrencies, I will retain the existing portfolio and keep an eye out for future opportunities.\n\n### Conclusion\nFor today:\n- **Hold existing positions** (ADA, AVAX, BTC, DOT, ETH, LINK, LTC, SOL, SUI, XRP).\n- **Cash reserves** will remain available for any new high-potential trades that may arise soon.\n\nI'll continue monitoring the market for any breakthrough signals and adjustments.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
