Therefore, here's the course of action:\n\n1. **No immediate trades**: There's no trend reversal to act upon given the stagnant price action.\n2. **Maintain positions**: All positions remain intact, as there is no evidence of a significant loss (>5%) to cut any positions.\n3. **Consideration for New Opportunities**: Maintain vigil for any emerging catalysts or market news that may indicate a potential trade opportunity.\n\n### Next Steps\nSince there is a lack of significant movement, I will keep the positions as they are. However, I will continue to monitor for any news or price changes. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
