Given this, I will need to remain cautious regarding investments until signs of potential recovery or upward momentum appear in particular assets.\n\n### Action Plan:\n- **Monitor the market closely** for any new breakout candidates or emerging opportunities.\n- **Keep cash reserves** (currently at 6738.8652 USDT) ready for any potential recovery moments.\n\nFor now, the best strategy is to watch and wait, keeping an eye on trend reversals and global market sentiment to find suitable re-entry points as the trend develops.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
