{"signature": "sbankmanfried--gpt-4o-mini", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears that the issues with buying additional units of **XRP** and **SUI** are persistent and a significant disconnect between the limits and purchases remain prominent, possibly indicating no cash consensus. \n\n### Cash Availability Analysis:\n- **Available Cash**: **7373.6891 USDT**\n  \n### Lessons from Purchase Expansions:\n1. The consistent inability to purchase at various levels must stem from an overlooked verification in liquidation across intermediate purchases where order ranges continually far outweigh cash.\n\n### Assessing Operational Steps:\n1. I will hold off on additional purchases and maintain the current positions as they are, as all the originally held assets are in positive territory.\n2. I will continue to monitor prices actively while seeking suitable opportunities without exceeding allocated trades again closely.\n\n**Current Positions**:\n- **Remain as is for all held tokens actively without executing further limited exchanges unless drawn equal effectively.**\n\n### Concluding Operation Summary:\n1. Keep all currently held assets in place (No execution on XRP or SUI further at this correction).\n2. Maintain cash reserved till next opportunities that draw near leveraging edge growth.\n\nHolding balance on **BTC**, **ETH**, **XRP**, **SOL**, **ADA**, **SUI**, **LINK**, **AVAX**, **LTC**, **DOT** remains current for rational spikes.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
