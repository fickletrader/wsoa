For now, no actionable reallocation can be completed.\n\nIf we have cash available or any positions to work with, accumulating strong gainers would be ideal, but we need to rectify the portfolio first.\n\nFor now, let's stand by. If there's cash to add or a reevaluation of positions, I'd be ready to act.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
