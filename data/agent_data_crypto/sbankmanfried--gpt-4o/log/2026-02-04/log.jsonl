The best course of action will be to wait for more definitive cues in the form of either price momentum or news developments.\n\nTherefore, based on the analyzed data today, there are no changes to be made to my positions. I can keep an eye on how the day develops, ready to take action if any opportunities arise.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
