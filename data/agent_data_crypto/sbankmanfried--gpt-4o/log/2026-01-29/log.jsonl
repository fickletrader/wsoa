Given the data and my trading philosophy to let winners run and cut losers quickly:\n\n1. **No Current Positions**: As I currently hold no positions and there's no apparent momentum to act on from the data:\n   - **No Buying or Selling**: I'll refrain from initiating any new trades without clear emerging trends or stronger momentum signals.\n   - **Maintain Cash**: Retain my cash position for when a clear trend becomes apparent.\n\nIn conclusion, since the market is relatively stagnant today with no clear breakout opportunities or trend reversals apparent from the calculations or news, I'll hold my cash position for now and stay alert to new developments.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
