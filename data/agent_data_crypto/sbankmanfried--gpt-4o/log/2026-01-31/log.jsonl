According to the error messages, I do not actually hold \\$50,000 in cash reserves. This misunderstanding appears to stem from a previously entered error or misconfiguration in the cash balance available. The accurate cash available is extremely low.\n\nTo proceed effectively, it seems there isn't enough available cash to buy significant amounts of major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, or SOL without further clarification or realignment in the strategy.\n\nGiven that I can't effectively invest as planned due to the erroneous cash balance, the next logical step is to hold off on any new investments until more cash or opportunities arise, or until further clarification is provided regarding the actual available balance.\n\nMy task is complete for now given the current information and constraints.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
