However, I successfully acquired additional ADA and XRP.\n\n### Updated Actions:\n\n- **Assets Bought**:\n  - **ADA-USDT**: 50 units\n  - **XRP-USDT**: 100 units\n\n- **Assets Remaining to Consider**:\n  - **BTC-USDT**: Could not purchase due to insufficient cash.\n  - **LTC-USDT**: Could not purchase due to insufficient cash.\n\nGiven the constraints, it appears prudent to hold current positions in BTC and LTC as they don't show negative momentum immediately warranting a sell decision. The slight positive momentum could still play out favorably.\n\nI'll proceed with monitoring these positions closely without selling any weak performers unless there is a more pronounced downward trend, as the slight movements today don’t indicate urgent actions. We'll also need to await any major changes in market conditions that could alter current strategies.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
