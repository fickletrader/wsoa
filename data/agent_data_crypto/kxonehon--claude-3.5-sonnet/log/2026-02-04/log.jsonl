Trimmed XRP position to take profits and reduce risk\n3. Adjusted SOL position to maintain risk parameters\n4. Maintained ETH position as it's within acceptable range\n5. Increased cash position to better align with our conservative strategy\n\nOur cash position has improved but is still below our 40% target. We'll maintain this more defensive stance and wait for better entry points or market stability before deploying additional capital.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
