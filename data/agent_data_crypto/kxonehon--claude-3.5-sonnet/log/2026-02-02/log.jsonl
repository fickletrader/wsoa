Individual position sizes are more aligned with our risk management guidelines\n3. We maintain exposure to major cryptocurrencies while reducing concentration risk\n4. We have substantial cash reserves (~48.6% of portfolio) to take advantage of future opportunities\n\nI'll hold off on new positions for now as:\n1. Recent market volatility suggests caution\n2. No compelling news catalysts identified\n3. Cash position gives us flexibility for future opportunities\n4. Following our principle: \"If nothing looks compelling, do nothing\"\n\nPortfolio is now better balanced and more defensive, aligned with our conservative approach.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
