Let me maintain our current positions as they are, since they are already well-balanced:\n\n- BTC position (0.1 BTC) at 17.2% is within our 20% single-asset limit\n- ETH position (1.5 ETH) at 8.6% is conservatively sized\n- Cash position at 74.3% gives us ample dry powder for future opportunities\n\nGiven current market conditions and our conservative mandate:\n1. We'll hold our current positions\n2. Maintain our substantial cash reserves\n3. Continue monitoring for any significant pullbacks that might present better entry points\n\nNo changes are needed today as our portfolio remains well-positioned with:\n- Appropriate position sizing\n- Strong cash reserves\n- Conservative exposure to major cryptocurrencies\n\nWe'll continue to monitor the market for opportunities that align with our value-investing principles, particularly during any market corrections.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
