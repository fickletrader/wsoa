Given the current portfolio weights and the absence of news, let's proceed to analyze if there is a need for rebalancing based on the weights and diversification strategy:\n\n- The crypto assets are approximately evenly distributed with individual weights close to 13%.\n- Cash is at approximately 34.63%, which is within the 20-30% target range but slightly higher. \n\nGiven these circumstances, I would recommend:\n- Keeping the cash reserve stable to maintain flexibility but look for opportunities to reinvest if desirable entry points present themselves.\n- Maintaining current crypto position weights as they are nearly balanced and are each responsibly under the 15% mark, aligning well for diversification purposes.\n\nNo immediate rebalancing actions are necessary without news or market changes suggesting potential optimization.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
