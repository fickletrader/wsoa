This suggests that the market conditions for these assets are relatively stable currently, without any major external news-driven factors affecting sentiment.\n\nNext, let's decide if rebalancing is needed. Given the current percentage distributions, all assets are fairly well aligned toward the target exposure each, and cash is within the ideal 20-30% range. None of the distributions appear overly imbalanced at this moment.\n\nWith the absence of significant news and the current balanced weights, there's no immediate need for rebalancing. However, I will keep monitoring conditions closely for any future adjustments based on new developments or significant market movements.\n\n**Conclusion**: No rebalancing actions are needed today. Cash remains a strong buffer, and individual asset exposures are balanced. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
