Given this situation and the current portfolio allocation, the following actions are options based on our strategy:\n\n1. Maintain the current allocation as most cryptocurrencies hold nearly equal weights, and cash serves as a significant risk buffer.\n2. Consider slightly increasing or decreasing exposure to specific cryptocurrencies if there are qualitative reasons outside the news or if a high correlation among assets is anticipated — such as global market trend predictions or upcoming events.\n\nSince the portfolio is diversified, and cash provides a significant buffer, no immediate changes are required. Nevertheless, remaining updated on macroeconomic events and continuing to monitor price changes can provide cues for future rebalancing. \n\nIf no further action is necessary, we will remain with the current allocation plan and keep watching the market for potential updates in signals or news.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
