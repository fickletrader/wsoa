Here's a brief recap:\n- Portfolio cash is properly within the 20-30% target range.\n- The weights are more evenly distributed among the cryptocurrency holdings.\n\nI will continue monitoring news and market conditions to reassess the portfolio as needed. If you have any further questions or operations, feel free to ask.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
