Here’s a summary of the adjustments:\n\n### Updated Crypto Asset Holdings:\n- **XRP-USDT** increased to 6,489.85 units.\n- **ADA-USDT** increased to 12,308.33 units.\n- **SUI-USDT** increased to 5,137.06 units.\n- **LINK-USDT** increased to 728.85 units.\n\n### Remaining Cash:\n- The remaining cash is approximately $1,294.94.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. The cash allocation is now considerably lower and requires monitoring to ensure we maintain liquidity for potential opportunities or volatility.\n2. The increase in XRP, ADA, SUI, and LINK should help balance the weights more evenly across the portfolio.\n\nWith the current setup, my objective of diversifying and managing risk via an equal-weighted approach with a reasonable cash cushion is mostly accomplished given the available resources. These adjustments maintain our approach of diversified exposure while strategically utilizing cash reserves. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
