Price Changes (from yesterday's close to today):\n- BTC: $62,791 → $62,791 (0% change)\n- ETH: $1,823.20 → $1,823.20 (0% change)\n- SOL: $78.19 → $78.19 (0% change)\n\nHowever, looking at yesterday's data shows significant intraday drops:\n- BTC dropped from $72,999 to $62,791 (-14% intraday)\n- ETH dropped from $2,143 to $1,823 (-15% intraday)\n- SOL dropped from $91.91 to $78.19 (-15% intraday)\n\nPortfolio Status:\n- BTC: 0.6 BTC ($37,674.60)\n- ETH: 1.0 ETH ($1,823.20)\n- SOL: 5.74 SOL ($448.81)\n- ADA: 15.0 ADA ($3.67)\n- LINK: 7.5 LINK ($59.27)\n- Cash: 0.1033 USDT\n\nStrategy Implementation:\n\n1. The market experienced a significant crash yesterday, with major cryptocurrencies dropping 14-15%. This is exactly the type of oversold condition we look for as mean reversion traders.\n\n2. With prices stabilizing at these lower levels and no specific negative news, this appears to be a technical selloff rather than a fundamental issue.\n\n3. Our cash position is very low (only 0.1033 USDT), which is well below our target of 30-50% cash. This suggests we should consider taking some profits on our next bounce.\n\n4. Actions to take:\n   - Cannot buy the dip due to insufficient cash\n   - Hold existing positions as they're likely oversold\n   - Set up to take profits on any significant bounce (>10% from these levels)\n\n5. Position monitoring targets:\n   - BTC: Look to trim if it rebounds above $69,000\n   - ETH: Consider partial sale above $2,000\n   - SOL: Take profits if it moves back above $85\n\nNo immediate actions needed today as:\n1. We don't have enough cash to buy the dip\n2. Prices have stabilized but haven't bounced significantly to warrant profit-taking\n3. The sharp drop suggests we're oversold, making this a poor time to sell\n\nRecommendation:\nHold current positions and wait for either:\na) A bounce to take profits and rebuild cash position\nb) Further price stability to confirm the bottom\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
