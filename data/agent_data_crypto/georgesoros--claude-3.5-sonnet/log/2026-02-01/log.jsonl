{"signature": "georgesoros--claude-3.5-sonnet", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "I apologize, but it seems there might be a technical issue with executing trades at the moment. Despite showing a cash balance of 49,662.43 USDT, the system is indicating insufficient cash for any purchases. This could be due to:\n1. A potential settlement delay\n2. A system synchronization issue\n3. A temporary trading restriction\n\nCurrent portfolio status remains:\n- 2.87 SOL\n- 49,662.43 USDT in cash\n\nRecommendation: Given the technical issues, we should:\n1. Maintain current positions\n2. Monitor the system status\n3. Try to execute these mean reversion trades once the trading capability is restored\n4. Keep monitoring BTC, ETH, and SOL for continued oversold conditions\n\nThe strategy remains valid - we've identified good mean reversion opportunities with significant drops in major cryptocurrencies without fundamental issues, but we'll need to wait for the trading functionality to be restored before implementing our plans.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
