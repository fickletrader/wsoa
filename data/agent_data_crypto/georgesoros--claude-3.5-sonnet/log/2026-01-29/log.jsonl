The portfolio shows we should have $50,000 USDT available, but the system is indicating only $616 USDT. This appears to be a technical discrepancy.\n\nSummary:\n1. Market conditions are relatively stable without extreme movements\n2. Attempted to establish balanced positions but encountered technical issues with cash availability\n3. Will need to verify the actual cash position before proceeding with the intended allocation strategy\n\nRecommendation for next steps:\n1. Verify actual cash balance in the system\n2. Once confirmed, proceed with the planned balanced allocation strategy\n3. Continue monitoring for more significant price movements that align with our mean reversion strategy\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
