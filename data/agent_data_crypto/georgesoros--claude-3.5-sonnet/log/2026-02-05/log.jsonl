Since we can't execute the sell order, we'll need to maintain our current positions.\n\nSummary:\n- Market is currently in a consolidation phase with no extreme moves\n- Our positions are relatively stable but cash reserves are very low\n- Unable to rebalance positions due to execution constraints\n- Will continue monitoring for mean reversion opportunities, particularly any significant drops that could present buying opportunities once we have more cash available\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
