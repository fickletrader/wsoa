{"signature": "georgesoros--claude-3.5-sonnet", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "I apologize again - it seems our cash position is not currently available for trading. This could be due to settlement times or other restrictions. \n\nSummary and Recommendations:\n1. Our portfolio is relatively well-positioned despite today's market weakness\n2. The dips in SOL (-6.4%) and ETH (-4.87%) appear to be sentiment-driven rather than fundamental\n3. We should maintain our current positions and wait for our cash to become available for trading\n4. Once cash is available, we should look to add to SOL and ETH positions on continued weakness\n5. No immediate selling is required as none of our positions have experienced significant upside moves\n\nWe'll continue monitoring the situation and look to execute our mean reversion strategy when our cash position becomes available for trading.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
