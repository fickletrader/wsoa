Increases our cash position significantly to ~14,104 USDT\n3. Better positions us for future opportunities\n\nThe market is currently showing low volatility, which is unusual for crypto markets. With our increased cash position, we're now better prepared to take advantage of any significant price movements in either direction. We'll maintain our current positions in ETH, SOL, ADA, and LINK as they are already at reasonable levels and showing stable price action.\n\nStrategy for next session:\n1. Watch for any assets showing >5% drops as potential buying opportunities\n2. Monitor for any sudden spikes that might present profit-taking opportunities\n3. Consider redistributing some cash if we see compelling entry points in underweight assets\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
