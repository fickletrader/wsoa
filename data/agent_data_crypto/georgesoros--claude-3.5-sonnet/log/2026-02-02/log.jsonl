Let me summarize our strategy:\n\nSummary:\n1. Portfolio is relatively well-positioned with:\n   - Moderate BTC exposure (0.5 BTC)\n   - Small SOL position (5.74 SOL)\n   - Healthy cash position ($10,035.82)\n2. Current market conditions show moderate weakness but no extreme moves\n3. No significant negative news affecting our holdings\n4. Maintaining current positions is prudent given:\n   - Price drops haven't reached our -5% threshold for major buying\n   - No extreme moves requiring immediate action\n   - Healthy cash position allows us to act on future opportunities\n\nRecommendation: HOLD current positions and maintain cash reserves for more significant dips. Continue monitoring for opportunities where assets drop more than 5% without fundamental deterioration.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
