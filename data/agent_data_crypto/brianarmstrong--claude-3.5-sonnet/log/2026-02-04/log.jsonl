This means I can't execute any trades at the moment since there's no capital to work with. \n\nKey takeaways:\n1. Market showing significant weakness across major cryptocurrencies\n2. Would be ready to deploy capital aggressively on any signs of reversal\n3. Would prioritize BTC given its relative strength\n4. Would avoid SOL for now given its significant weakness and high volume selloff\n5. Need capital to execute the strategy\n\nPlease provide information about available capital/cash position to proceed with actual trading recommendations.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
