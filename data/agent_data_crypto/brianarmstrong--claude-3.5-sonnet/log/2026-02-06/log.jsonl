Let me analyze the market situation first:\n\nLooking at the price action from yesterday (2026-02-05):\n\nBTC-USDT:\n- Opened: $72,999\n- Closed: $62,791\n- Massive -14% drop\n- High volume sell-off\n\nSOL-USDT:\n- Opened: $91.91\n- Closed: $78.19\n- Similarly large -15% drop\n- Heavy volume\n\nKey Observations:\n1. We're seeing a significant market-wide correction\n2. Both BTC and SOL showed similar percentage drops\n3. High volume suggests potential capitulation\n4. No relevant news found to explain the crash, which could mean technical selling\n\nStrategy Recommendation:\nI would typically look to be aggressive here as this kind of drop often presents opportunities, but I'm constrained by our current situation - we have no capital to deploy.\n\nAction Required:\nBefore I can execute any trades, I need:\n1. Initial capital (USDT) to work with\n2. Confirmation if there are any existing positions\n\nOnce you provide this information, I can:\n- Look for oversold bounce opportunities\n- Set up aggressive entries if we see momentum shift\n- Take advantage of this high-volatility environment\n\nPlease provide the available capital and any existing positions so I can execute a proper trading strategy."}}
