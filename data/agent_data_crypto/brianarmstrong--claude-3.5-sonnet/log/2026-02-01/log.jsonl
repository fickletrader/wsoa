Let me summarize our current portfolio:\n\nCurrent Positions:\n- BTC-USDT: 0.263 BTC (≈ $20,684)\n- ETH-USDT: 2.7 ETH (≈ $6,613)\n- XRP-USDT: 5000 XRP (≈ $8,227)\n- SOL-USDT: 88.5 SOL (≈ $9,331)\n- Cash: $318.23 USDT\n\nAnalysis of Current Portfolio:\n1. We have a good diversified position across major cryptocurrencies\n2. BTC is our largest position (~46% of portfolio) - aligned with our aggressive strategy\n3. SOL, ETH, and XRP provide good exposure to different segments of the market\n4. We're nearly fully deployed with minimal cash, which fits our strategy\n\nThe portfolio is actually well-positioned for a potential market recovery, with:\n- Strong BTC exposure for market leadership\n- Significant SOL position to capture L1 momentum\n- ETH position for smart contract platform exposure\n- XRP position for financial services sector exposure\n\nI'll monitor these positions closely and be ready to rotate quickly if any positions show weakness. For now, the distribution looks appropriate for our aggressive momentum strategy.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
