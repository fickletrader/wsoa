It seems we don't have any initial capital showing in the current positions. Could you please confirm our available trading capital? Without this information, I cannot execute any trades.\n\nOnce you provide the available capital information, I'll proceed with implementing an aggressive momentum-based strategy focusing on:\n1. Large position in SOL (planned 40% allocation)\n2. Medium position in BTC (planned 30% allocation)\n3. Smaller positions in ETH and LINK (planned 15% each)\n\nPlease let me know the available trading capital so I can size these positions appropriately.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
