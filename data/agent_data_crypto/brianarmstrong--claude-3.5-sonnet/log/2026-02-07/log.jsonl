Cash: 616 USDT - about 1.2% of portfolio\n\nThis is exactly how I like to trade:\n- Heavily concentrated in the strongest momentum plays\n- BTC as the primary position with clear breakout momentum\n- SOL as secondary position with strong correlation and its own momentum\n- Minimal cash position - money deployed where it can work\n- Ready to cut quickly if momentum shifts\n\nI'll be watching these positions closely and won't hesitate to cut if they show any weakness, but right now the momentum is strong and I'm positioned aggressively to capture it.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
