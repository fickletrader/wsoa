This may indicate a lack of new market drivers for these assets.\n\n### Portfolio Evaluation\n- As I don't have any current positions, I'll evaluate buying opportunities with strong convictions based on price movements and the news absence.\n- Current prices have shown fluctuations, but none have dropped significantly enough to present a compelling buying opportunity based solely on value or sentiment.\n\n### Cash Position and Recommendations\n- With **0%** positions currently held and **40%** cash reserve, this allows flexibility for buying on pullbacks.\n- Given the current market, no asset shows strong conviction for a buy at these price points. The market remains volatile.\n\n### Conclusion\nI will hold my cash position and wait for more compelling investment opportunities or for significant pullbacks below current levels before allocating capital into any assets.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
