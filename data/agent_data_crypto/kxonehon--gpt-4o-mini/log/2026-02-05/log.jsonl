Currently, all holdings must be evaluated to determine if any position has grown disproportionately.\n3. **Market Conditions**: There are no significant news catalysts pointing to upside potential or risks as per the recent news search.\n\n### Next Steps\nGiven the slight pullbacks across the board:\n1. Reevaluate each position to see if they still meet the criteria for holding.\n2. Trim any position that may have grown too large relative to the portfolio.\n\nLet's move on with the evaluation and potential trimming of these positions if required. However, without specific holdings provided, I cannot trim yet. \n\nIf you have specific holdings or additional instructions, please provide that information. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
