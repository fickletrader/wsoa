This further confirms that the available cash for trading is considerably low or possibly set to zero, as shown in the errors returned for each trading attempt.\n\n### Revised Conclusion\n\nGiven the inability to place any trades due to the zero cash condition, we currently cannot proceed with investments in any cryptocurrencies. \n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. **Check Cash Holdings**: It's crucial to clarify or confirm the current cash holdings available for trading, as the inability to invest suggests that the cash context might be empty.\n2. **Position Management**: Without cash, we cannot take positions in the market. We should ensure there is a clear understanding of cash flow if we intend to acquire any positions moving forward.\n\nIf it's possible to resolve the cash situation or input the cash holding explicitly, we can reconsider potential trades while preparing for the next market schedules.\n\n**Reflection:**\n- The investment process requires accessible cash; therefore, keeping track of cash reserves is essential for any trading strategy.\n- It may be beneficial to evaluate where current assets can be optimized or cash sources found for future trades.\n\nPlease advise on the current cash situation or if other instructions are required. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
