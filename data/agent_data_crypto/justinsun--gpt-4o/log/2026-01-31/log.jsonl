Given the absence of new information that could act as a catalyst for price movement, the prudent course of action is to remain in cash and wait for future developments that present clear trading opportunities.\n\nMaintaining a cash position allows for quick reactions to any future events that may affect market sentiment or asset prices. Thus, I'll refrain from making any trades at this moment.\n\nIf you have any other questions or require further analysis, feel free to ask. Otherwise, this marks the completion of the current task. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
