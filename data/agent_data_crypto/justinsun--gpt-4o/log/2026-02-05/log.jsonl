Since there are no meaningful catalysts or news that might impact their prices significantly, I will:\n\n- Maintain the current position of being entirely in cash, as there's no new information to warrant any buying or selling activity.\n- Continue monitoring the market for any emerging news that could act as a catalyst. \n\nTherefore, I will not execute any trades today. \n\nI'll output the finish signal now. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
