We'll maintain our current positions for now and continue monitoring the market for new momentum opportunities. The lack of strong upward momentum in our holdings suggests we should be patient and wait for clearer trends to emerge before making new entries.\n\nKey Watch Points for Next Session:\n1. Monitor if BTC can break above $77,000 with conviction\n2. Watch for any reversal in SOL's downward momentum\n3. Keep cash ready for new opportunities when stronger trends emerge\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
