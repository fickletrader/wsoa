I'll continue monitoring the market situation with our current holdings. The key points remain:\n\n1. Both BTC and SOL are showing concerning weakness\n2. We should maintain a defensive position and look for new opportunities when clear upward momentum returns\n3. Keep monitoring BTC position closely for any further deterioration that would trigger our stop loss\n\nGiven the current market conditions, we'll:\n- Hold our current positions\n- Monitor closely for any further deterioration\n- Wait for clear signs of renewed momentum before deploying more capital\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
