{"signature": "sbankmanfried--claude-3.5-sonnet", "new_messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "Summary:\n- The market is showing extremely strong momentum, with BTC, ETH, and SOL all having made significant gains yesterday\n- However, we appear to have very limited capital to work with and all our attempts to enter positions were unsuccessful due to insufficient funds\n- For future trading, we'll need either additional capital or to wait for a better entry point with our limited funds\n- The trend remains strongly bullish across major cryptocurrencies, suggesting we should look to enter on any minor pullbacks\n\nRecommendation for next steps:\n1. Monitor for any minor pullbacks that might allow us to enter with our limited capital\n2. Focus on lower-priced alternatives that our current capital can afford\n3. Consider adding more capital to take advantage of the strong market momentum\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
