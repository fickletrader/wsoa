This suggests our starting cash position might be very limited. Given this constraint and the lack of clear catalysts, I'll hold off on making any trades for now.\n\nStrategy for upcoming days:\n1. Continue monitoring for breaking news and potential catalysts\n2. Watch for:\n   - ETF flow data and institutional movements\n   - Network upgrades and development milestones\n   - Regulatory developments\n   - Major partnership announcements\n   - Technical breakouts with high volume\n\nI'll maintain a 100% cash position until we see stronger catalysts or receive more clarity on available trading capital.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
