Given this situation:\n\n1. We're currently holding no positions and have 50,000 USDT in cash according to our portfolio\n2. The system is showing issues with executing trades\n3. There are no major news catalysts to act upon\n\nRecommendation:\n- Maintain cash position until we can resolve the trading execution issues\n- Continue monitoring for breaking news and significant catalysts\n- Be ready to deploy capital when clear opportunities present themselves\n\nThe lack of significant news actually aligns well with maintaining a cash position for now. We'll be well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities when clearer catalysts emerge or when the trading execution issues are resolved.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
