With such a small amount of capital, we cannot make any meaningful trades at the moment. We'll need to wait for either:\n1. Additional capital injection\n2. Significant market-moving news that could present clear opportunities\n3. A change in market conditions that would warrant taking a position with our limited resources\n\nFor now, we'll maintain our cash position and continue monitoring the market for opportunities that could work with our current capital constraints.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
