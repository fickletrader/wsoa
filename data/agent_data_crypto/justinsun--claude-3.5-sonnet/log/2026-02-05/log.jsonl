We already have strong exposure to the market leaders (BTC, ETH)\n2. We have complementary positions in strong Layer 1s (SOL, ADA)\n3. We have DeFi exposure through LINK\n4. We maintain minimal cash (0.1033 USDT) for now given the bullish market conditions\n\nThe portfolio is well-diversified across different crypto sectors and maintains exposure to both established and growing projects. Given the strong price levels and absence of negative news, I recommend holding these positions for now and monitoring for any breaking news that might require position adjustments.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
