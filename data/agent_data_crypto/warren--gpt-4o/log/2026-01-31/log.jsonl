This may imply a stable or unchanged market perception.\n\n3. **Portfolio Evaluation:**\n   - SOL-USDT, making up approximately 1.88% of the portfolio's total value, remains well below the maximum 20% single asset allocation policy.\n   - With the significant portion in cash (approximately 98.12%), the portfolio is aligned with your strategic emphasis on cash and caution in volatile markets.\n\n**Decision:**\n- **Hold SOL**: There’s no compelling reason to sell SOL given that it's a small part of the portfolio and there's no adverse news.\n- **Cash Position**: The cash level remains high, providing flexibility to take advantage of dips or exceptional opportunities.\n- **No New Buys**: Without high conviction or favorable entry points based on available information, maintaining current positions is prudent.\n\nConcluding the assessment for today with the current holdings. The portfolio remains defensive with substantial cash ready to deploy if opportunities arise. \n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
