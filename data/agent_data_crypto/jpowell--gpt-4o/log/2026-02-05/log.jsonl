The errors suggest problems with recognizing available holdings and cash despite my previous calculations showing sufficient resources.\n\n### Final Steps:\n1. Verify if there is any issue with trade execution parameters or an inconsistency with current data.\n2. Focus on risk-adjusted balance and reset positions on confirmed data.\n\nGiven repeated execution failures, a detailed review may be required outside the automated options available here. The strategy remains aligning holdings to seek diversification while observing calculated execution results.\n\nI will finalize the current management process. Thank you for your patience.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
