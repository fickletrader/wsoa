As of now, all actions relating to cash spending are currently impeded. Thus, the current solution is to wait for any updates on the portfolio based on the rebalance already performed on BTC.\n\nAs a workaround, since BTC was successfully trimmed, I suggest monitoring the future price movement of current holdings and conducting comprehensive research on each crypto for potential market enhancements. \n\nWhile direct rebalancing through trades was challenging in this cycle, keeping the portfolio mostly intact while complying with diversification principles remains vital.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
