Research whether drops are fundamental or sentiment-driven.\n4. Execute trades to buy oversold positions with intact fundamentals or take profits on overbought positions.\n\nFirst, I need to know your current positions to perform the analysis.

Let's do this to identify any major price changes that can signify oversold or overbought conditions.\n\nCalculating the percentage changes for each asset:\n\n- ADA: ((0.2989 - 0.2989) / 0.2989) * 100 = 0%\n- AVAX: ((10.14 - 10.140) / 10.140) * 100 = 0%\n- BTC: ((78666.85 - 78666.85) / 78666.85) * 100 = 0%\n- DOT: ((1.541 - 1.541) / 1.541) * 100 = 0%\n- ETH: ((2345.11 - 2345.11) / 2345.11) * 100 = 0%\n- LINK: ((9.801 - 9.801) / 9.801) * 100 = 0%\n- LTC: ((59.97 - 59.97) / 59.97) * 100 = 0%\n- SOL: ((104.46 - 104.46) / 104.46) * 100 = 0%\n- SUI: ((1.1485 - 1.1485) / 1.1485) * 100 = 0%\n- XRP: ((1.6183 - 1.6183) / 1.6183) * 100 = 0%\n\nGiven the calculations, I found no significant price changes indicative of oversold or overbought conditions. \n\nHowever, since no information on your current positions and available cash was provided, I can't execute any trades today.
