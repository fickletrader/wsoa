Therefore, there are no immediate buy or sell actions required based on extreme moves. \n\nHowever, maintaining a balanced exposure and healthy cash reserve remains critical, so I'll ensure that the portfolio's cash position aligns with the 30-50% requirement. Since no detailed portfolio information was provided initially, it would be prudent to ensure alignment with strategy moving forward.\n\nGiven that there's nothing further required at this point, I'll conclude the operations.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
