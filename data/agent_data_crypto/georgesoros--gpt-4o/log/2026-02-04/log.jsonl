Calculate the performance of each asset by comparing current prices with yesterday's prices.\n2. Identify which assets have experienced significant price changes (either a drop of 5% or more or a rise of 10% or more).\n3. Research whether any significant drop is related to fundamentals or merely sentiment-driven.\n4. Adjust positions by buying assets that are oversold (if fundamentals are intact) and selling assets that are overbought (taking profits).\n5. Ensure portfolio balance and maintain a healthy cash reserve.\n\nSince I don't currently have yesterday's positions, I'll need that information to proceed. Could you provide or confirm yesterday's positions?"}}
