Therefore, there are no mean reversion opportunities at the moment for either buying dips or taking profits from surges. \n\nSince no meaningful price discrepancies were observed, we will maintain the current cash position, awaiting any future opportunities that may arise from significant market fluctuations.\n\nThus, no immediate actions are needed today given the current market state and position.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
