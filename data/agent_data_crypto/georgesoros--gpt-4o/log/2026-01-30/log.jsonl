Here is the analysis:\n\n- **BTC-USDT**: No change from yesterday, both closing price and current price are 84,513.20.\n- **ETH-USDT**: No change from yesterday, both closing price and current price are 2,817.79.\n- **XRP-USDT**: No change from yesterday, both closing price and current price are 1.8046.\n- **SOL-USDT**: No change from yesterday, both closing price and current price are 117.61.\n- **ADA-USDT**: No change from yesterday, both closing price and current price are 0.3341.\n- **SUI-USDT**: No change from yesterday, both closing price and current price are 1.3189.\n- **LINK-USDT**: Slight decrease from yesterday's close of 11.102 to today's price of 11.104.\n- **AVAX-USDT**: No change from yesterday, both closing price and current price are 11.03.\n- **LTC-USDT**: No change from yesterday, both closing price and current price are 66.15.\n- **DOT-USDT**: Small decrease from yesterday's close of 1.735 to the price of 1.736.\n\nSince all cryptocurrencies have no significant price changes (no movements greater than 5%), there are no immediate buy or sell signals based on today's analysis. I will ensure to maintain at least 30-50% cash to capitalize on future opportunities.\n\n**Current cash position**: $50,000\n\nWith no urgent changes needed and healthy cash levels maintained, I will hold the current cash-only position awaiting more distinctive market conditions for mean reversion opportunities.\n\nIf you need any further information or future planning regarding others oversight, let me know.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
